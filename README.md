# Portfolio Projects
### [Time Series Forecasting on Global Stock Prices](https://github.com/Daolaiya/vmzcTtY32ejVJbYS)
- Sourced stock price data from various global financial institutions over a 2 year period.
- Performed time series analysis on data to produce daily, weekly and monthly stock price predictions.
- Created investment strategies that made buy, sell and hold recommendations in response to market conditions using bollinger bands.
- Resulting models yielded profits up to 20% of initial investment and registered no losses when used on test data.
- Employed time-series processing techniques including ARIMA modelling, simple exponential smoothing, LSTMs, facebook prophet and rolling forecasts among others.

### [Image Recognition for Document Digitization](https://github.com/Daolaiya/iTgTyUmUQ7igs7pM)
- Developed image prediction models to be used in tandem with software for manual, page-by-page digitization or scanning.
- Trained models to determine the endpoints between a page being fully displayed and a page that is being flipped to aid in accurate, legible scanning of book pages.
- Resulting models showed more than 90% accuracy with test data.
- Employed deep-learning image classification frameworks including ResNet and MobileNet.

### [Ranking of Potential Candidates using Job Postings](https://github.com/Daolaiya/l4Xr09Wq1DFkXsRQ)
- Designed NLP models that take a hiring company's job posting, analyze the job titles and job descriptions of potential candidates, then rank all candidates based on their similarity to the given job description.
- Created a web interface that allows the user/operator to select their preferred candidates then updates the modelâ€™s ranking of all viable candidates in real time based on the new information.
- Employed NLP techniques such as word embedding, sentence transformation, vectorization, variable encoding and cross validation.

### [Predicting Likelihood of Investment using Demographic Data](https://github.com/Daolaiya/EQ33oG7lFS6Y2Uag)
- Designed models to determine the  likelihood of a customer investing in a bond/term deposit using the financial and demographic data of a banking institution.
- Resulting models yielded up to 88% accuracy in predicting likelihood of investment.
- Resulting models also highlighted the demographic/customer segment to target for future investment with regards to age, profession, marital status, bank balance, mortgage status and debt status.

### [Customer Satisfaction Prediction using Survey Data](https://github.com/Daolaiya/mountain-resort-pricing-strategy)
- Sourced data from the customer surveys of a Logistics and Delivery business including timeliness of delivery, pricing, courier performance, ease of app use, missing contents and overall satisfaction among others.
- Designed prediction models that evaluated and predicted customer satisfaction (satisfied or unsatisfied) using the survey data.
- Resulting models yielded accuracy up to ~80% when tested and identified the key components of the business operations which were responsible for maximizing customer satisfaction and minimizing customer turnover/churn.

### [Ticket Price Analysis for Ski Resorts](https://github.com/Daolaiya/mountain-resort-pricing-strategy)
- Sourced data from 330 ski resorts in the United States including ticket prices, skiable area, annual days of operation, location, mountain elevations, number of chairlifts/trams and  snowfall among others.
- Designed prediction models that assessed the relationship between ticket prices (weekend, weekday, adult, child) and the different features, attractions and facilities available at the resorts.
- Resulting models yielded insights into how the client could raise its profit margin by up to 21% through eliminating redundant costs, changing ticket pricing strategy and adding new cost-effective facilities to its resort.
